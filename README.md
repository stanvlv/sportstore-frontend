# Sportstore Frontend

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sportstore Frontend repository. This is an e-commerce application designed for learning and training purposes. 
The frontend is built using React and React Bootstrap, creating a dynamic and responsive user interface. 
This application is intended to work seamlessly with the Sportstore Backend, 
which you can find at [Sportstore Backend](https://github.com/stanvlv/sportstore-backend).
